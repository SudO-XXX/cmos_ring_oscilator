1.The third task (7 stages CMOS oscillator) is in the inverter library.

2.Each cell has the ADE L spectra state saved in it, in the ADE L ->session->load ->cellview->ok

3.for the first task, the parameters of the mosft needed for the outputs to be plotted
gm = pv("NM0" "gm" ?result "dcOpInfo-info")
ro = 1/pv("NM0" "gds" ?result "dcOpInfo-info")
vth = pv("NM0" "vth" ?result "dcOpInfo-info")
vov = pv("NM0" "vgs" ?result "dcOpInfo-info") - pv("NM0" "vth" ?result "dcOpInfo-info")
gm . ro = pv("NM0" "gm" ?result "dcOpInfo-info")/pv("NM0" "gds" ?result "dcOpInfo-info")

4.To import libraries in cadence just follow that tremendously great awasome video XD:
